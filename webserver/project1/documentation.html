    <p>In project1, I, as a complete novice, still mainly focus on familiarizing myself with html, css, <br>
        (mainly using tutorials): <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Wr4y1R7Bd/?spm_id_from=333.880.my_history.page. click&vd_source=9ad14fc1eec025c3715429d9f62bfa0e">https: //www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Wr4y1R7Bd/?spm_id_from=333.880.my_histor <br>
        y.page. click&vd_source=9ad14fc1eec025c3715429d9f62bfa0e.</a>

    <p>
        Because of limited time and energy, I mainly referred to pintrest, behance and other web pages to <br>
        write a personal homepage-like website. Although the main focus was to pile up images, I also accumulated <br>
        a lot of knowledge about basic grammar and logic in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, the whole project is just a pile of code with pictures and text. The process diagrams and whatnot aren't very important <br>
        (Attempts at typography in the selection bar above) <br>

    <p>
        I'm using too much effort to learn the code section taking a lot of the narrative interest out of my pages, <br>
        and would like to start with that if I can offer suggestions.
